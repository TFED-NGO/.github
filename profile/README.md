# Transatlantic Forum for Education and Diplomacy (TFED) GitHub Organization

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub organization of the Transatlantic Forum for Education and Diplomacy (TFED). Our organization is dedicated to hosting transcriptions and translations of texts, fostering cultural literacy, and supporting global understanding through the use of a specialized technology called EVT (Edition Visualization Technology). Additionally, we have developed our own version of EVT to enhance the accessibility and visualization of the content we curate.
About TFED

The Transatlantic Forum for Education and Diplomacy (TFED) is committed to developing programming that bridges the realms of international diplomacy and higher education. With a specific focus on transatlantic relations and the vital role of the humanities in nurturing cultural literacy, TFED collaborates with the Gillings Global Series to bring leading scholars, diplomats, journalists, and thought leaders to college campuses and the wider community.

## Opportunities for Students

TFED is actively involved in providing enriching opportunities for current university students. One such initiative is the UNC Literature and Diplomacy Study Abroad program, held annually at King’s College London. Undergraduate and graduate students from all universities are encouraged to apply, though seating is limited.

In addition, TFED offers travel scholarships every summer for students attending the UNC Literature and Diplomacy Study Abroad program at King’s College London. These scholarships aim to support students in their academic pursuits and global engagement.

### Purpose of the GitHub Organization

Our GitHub organization serves as a central repository for transcriptions and translations of texts related to our mission. We leverage the power of technology, specifically EVT, to visualize and present these texts in an engaging and educational manner. EVT enhances the learning experience, making information more accessible and promoting a deeper understanding of cultural, diplomatic, and literary topics.

## EVT Technology

### What is EVT?

Edition Visualization Technology (EVT) is a technology that we employ to enhance the educational impact of the texts we curate. EVT facilitates dynamic and interactive visualizations, making complex information more comprehensible and engaging for our audience.

### Our Custom EVT Version

In addition to utilizing EVT, we have developed our own customized version to better align with the unique needs of our organization. This customized version incorporates features tailored to our mission and the content we work with, providing an enhanced user experience for both contributors and consumers of our educational materials.
